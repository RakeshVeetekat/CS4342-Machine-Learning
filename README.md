# CS4342-Machine-Learning

The weekly homeworks of this course required the use of R to extract metrics from data given to us.

The term project is based off a Kaggle competition known as _Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster_, where machine learning is used to predict survivorship of passengers from the Titanic based on factors like passenger age, sex, ticket class, etc.
